# Air Time Challenge

**Air Time Challenge** is a simple 2D game where you control a player by applying torque. Try to keep your air time in checkâ€”stay airborne too long, and you'll get a warning before the game reloads.

- Arrow keys move the player left and right.
- The game reloads if the player's head hits obstacles.
- Tracks the player's air time.
- The game reloads if the player stays in the air too long.
- Air time text changes color to red when close to the maximum air time.
